      <p> These are my past 3D design works. Rendered realtime in-game engine for video game purposes. It was my first stop at the world of creativity and design. People asked me why I changed course. Well, although it was fun, there weren't many jobs for game designers. Also, it was a really time-consuming process. One model could take weeks depending on the complexity. Web programming and graphic design are more enjoyable for me. You can build your online world by just yourself.</p>
